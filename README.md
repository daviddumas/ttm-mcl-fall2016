Tangle Toy Moduli
=================

This is the code repository for an undergraduate research project *in
progress* at the
[Mathematical Computing Laboratory](http://mcl.math.uic.edu/)
at
[UIC](http://uic.edu/).

The purpose of this project is to create online visualization tools
for exploring the spaces of configurations (or *moduli spaces*) of
mechanical linkages constsing of quarter-circular struts connected by
rotating joints.  (Linkages of this type, sometimes called "tangle toys",
are often sold as desk toys.)

This project builds on work by Kasra Rafi and Gemma Zhang at the
University of Toronto.
